> Guiding questions

1. What topic are you exploring?

The topic I decided to explore for my second data analysis project is to determine what factors can lead to Heart Disease,
and to try and predict it.

2. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

Can the metrics included in this analysis predict a greater chance of heart disease? And if so, how can that information be leveraged to offset it.

3. What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?

The main metrics used in this analysis will be age, sex, resting bp,
cholesterol, fasting bs, max hr and exercise angina. There is also another metric
indicating whether a particular individual was already known to have heart
disease prior to having these specific metrics acquired.

4. Who are the stakeholders?

For this hypothetical scenario, the stakeholders are medical professionals or drug manufacturers that could benefit from the insights gained from this analysis. It could lead to earlier recommendations or treatments for individuals who are showing early signs of heart disease, such as a change in diet, exercise habits, etc.

5. Who is your audience?

The potential audience could be numerous. On one side, it could include individuals, such as drug makers and medical professionals that can leverage the insights gained from this analysis to better treat patients. 
It could also be leveraged to provide more general recommendations and guidelines to the public on nutrition and exercise, such as improving diet to lower cholesterol or blood pressure.

6. How can your insights help your client make decisions?

If the insights gained from this analysis provide a strong indication that these metrics in some way contribute to a greater chance of heart disease, the client can leverage it to provide better services or treatments for their patients.
